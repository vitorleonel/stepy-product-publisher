## About component structure

I decided to follow the structure of a component as we do here in the current company, so all components you will see a structure similar to the one below:

```
ComponentName.js
index.js
```

## What would I keep doing or would I add

From what is already in this repository, I would continue or add the following things:

- I would add the unit tests;
- I would add E2E tests to ensure flow;
- I would continue to adjust the lint's and prettier config;
- ...among other things that a real project would require
